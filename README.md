# Commands

`Poetic Shark` has a number of interactive features. `Poetic Shark` uses the newly launched `SlashCommand`
feature by Discord. Now, we don't have to spam `!help` to get instructions for running the bot. It's all in the `/`,
very convenient!

1. `/shark` is the main star of `Poetic Shark`. Express your feelings, emphasise your emotions, express
   your words with an accompanying image.
    - Users are able to choose from 6 images.
    - Each image shows the Bl√•haj shark in a scenario.
    - After picking one, users type out their caption and `Poetic Shark` creates the image with their caption.
    - Bonus 1: Make it a game. Come up with a 3 syllabus word (e.g computer) and caption a Bl√•haj image. Play with
      friends and see who's the best poet!
    - Bonus 2: `/shark` is friendly. It has a profanity filter to remove the negativity.


2. `/blahaj` is there, so you know where to find Bl√•haj sharks in IKEA.

    - Enter a country, get stock availability information for a random store in said country.
    - Now, you can let your friends which IKEA has Bl√•haj sharks, all in Discord.


3. `/randomsharkfact` gives informative information for a random shark species.

    - Get shark information and a picture of the shark type!
    - There is a large collection of shark pictures, so chances are, you'll get a different picture.


4. `/frenzy` allows you to show excitement. Or, drown out the Discord chat if it gets too boring.

    - Sends out a wave of ü¶à emojis to the Discord chat.
